                            <p>
                                Traditional AI coding assistants have been limited to code completion and simple suggestions. Replit's
                                Agent goes far beyond this, offering a comprehensive development environment that can understand complex
                                requirements and implement full-stack solutions.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The implications for developers and businesses are significant. Teams can now prototype and deploy
                                applications at unprecedented speed, while maintaining code quality and following best practices.
                            </p>
